Go through Basics of Robotic Systems and Kinematics:
- [Intro to Kinematics](https://motion.cs.illinois.edu/RoboticSystems/Kinematics.html)
- [python-Robotic-Toolkit](https://petercorke.github.io/robotics-toolbox-python/intro.html#denavit-hartenberg-parameters) by Peter Croke, explore this library from kinematics point of view, see how you can implement forward and inverse kinematics on any robo arm, use visualisations, etc.

Implentations
- Take a industrial robotic arm (eg. Puma560), find its DH parameters analytically
- Use robotic toolkit to manipulate this arm. Take the arm from point A to point B.
